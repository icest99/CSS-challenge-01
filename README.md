### What I learned

I first make a simple layout of the design with HTML tags, setup basic CSS for body.
For the card, at first I wasn't sure which layout style should I use (Grid vs Flex) so I watch a few video on these two subjects and I learned that I should use both. Flex is a content first design (Thing will resize and change according to the size of the items) and Grid is a layout first design. (Item will fit into the layout)

### Continued development

I was struggling with position item with flex a lot, so I think should practice using it a lot more.

### Useful resources

- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bst-EZHpuD8&ab_channel=AngelaDelise) - This helped me to a general idea of how to tackle these kind of problem. The ways she first begin with doing basic layout of everything with HTML first is nice, I like it. Also helped me in positioning/sizing the Music Icon which at first I wasn't sure how I would go about it.
- [Article](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bst-EZHpuD8&ab_channel=AngelaDelise) - This article explain how to use CSS Grid. He explain about Grid and what I really like is that he talk about using Grid Responsively with auto-fit I didin't use it in this project but I think it is going to be useful for my next projects.
